Based on the provided search results, here's a comprehensive answer focusing on `keyboard::{KeyCode, PhysicalKey}`:

**Key Values**

The search results provide tables and snippets detailing various key values for keyboard events. These include:

1. **Numeric Keypad Keys**: Decimal (0-9), F1-F12 function keys, and Enter/Return keys have corresponding key codes (e.g., `VK_DECIMAL`, `VK_F1`, `VK_RETURN`).
2. **Editing Keys**: Backspace, Delete, Insert, and Home/End keys have key codes (e.g., `VK_BACK`, `VK_DELETE`, `VK_INSERT`, `VK_HOME`, `VK_END`).
3. **Function Keys**: F1-F20 function keys have key codes (e.g., `VK_F1`, `VK_F20`).
4. **Modifier Keys**: Alt, Meta (Windows key or Command key), and Fn keys have key codes (e.g., `VK_MENU`, `VK_LMENU`, `VK_RMENU`, `VK_FN`).
5. **UI Keys**: Accept, Cancel, and Context Menu keys have key codes (e.g., `VK_ACCEPT`, `VK_CANCEL`, `VK_APPS`).

**Key Code Mapping**

Key codes are numeric values that correspond to physical keys on the keyboard, but do not necessarily correspond to a particular character. For example, the A key on the keyboard produces the same key code when pressed, regardless of whether the Shift key is down or not.

**IME Keys**

When using an Input Method Editor (IME) to input text, certain keys are used to input text that can't readily be entered by simple keypresses, such as text in languages with more graphemes than character entry keys on the keyboard.

**JavaScript and Unity**

In JavaScript, key codes are accessed through the `KeyboardEvent.code` property. In Unity, key codes are used with `Input.GetKeyDown` and `Input.GetKeyUp` to detect key down and key up events, respectively. Additionally, Unity provides `KeyCode` enum values for specific keys, such as `KeyCode.Space`, which can be used to detect key presses.

**Key Code Tables**

The search results provide tables listing key codes for various keys, including:

1. BCD tables (Browser Compatibility Database) listing key codes for physical keys on a typical U.S. English keyboard.
2. Unity's `KeyCode` enum values, which map to physical keys on the keyboard.
3. JavaScript's `KeyboardEvent.code` property values, which correspond to physical keys on the keyboard.

In summary, `keyboard::{KeyCode, PhysicalKey}` encompasses a range of key values, including numeric keypad keys, editing keys, function keys, modifier keys, UI keys, and IME keys. Key codes are used to detect key presses and releases in JavaScript and Unity, and are mapped to physical keys on the keyboard.
