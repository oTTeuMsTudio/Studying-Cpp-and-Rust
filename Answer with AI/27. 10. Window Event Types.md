Based on the provided search results, here's a comprehensive overview of `ElementState`, `Event`, and `WindowEvent`:

**ElementState**

* In the context of winit::event, `ElementState` is an enum that represents the state of an element, such as a keyboard key or a mouse button.
* It has variants like `Pressed`, `Released`, and `PressedAndHeld` to describe the state of the element.
* The `ElementState` enum is used in events like `KeyboardInput` and `MouseInput` to indicate the state of the corresponding element.

**Event**

* In the context of winit::event, an `Event` is a generic term for any event that can occur in a window, such as keyboard input, mouse movement, or window resize.
* Events are used to notify the application of changes in the window's state or user interactions.
* The `Event` enum is not a direct equivalent to `ElementState`, but rather a broader category that encompasses various types of events.

**WindowEvent**

	+ Resized: The window's size has changed.
	+ Moved: The window's position has changed.

	+ Destroyed: The window has been destroyed.
