# Function Signature Definition
Based on the provided search results, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the concept of a function signature:

**General Definition**: A function signature defines the unique identifier of a function, comprising:

1. **Name**: The identifier given to the function.
2. **Parameters**: The number and types of input arguments the function takes.
3. **Return Type**: The type of value the function returns.

**Key Points**:

* The names of the parameters are not part of the signature, as the caller only needs to know the number and types of input arguments to call the function (Python, C++).
* In Python, type hints were introduced to clarify the signature, but the parameter names are still not considered part of the signature.
* In languages like C++, the same method name can exist with multiple signatures, and the types of input arguments determine which one will be called.
* Function modifiers, such as access control (e.g., `onlyOwner` in Solidity), can also be part of the signature, influencing the function's behavior.

**Example Signatures**:

* `fn hello(str, int) -> String`: A Python function `hello` taking two parameters, a string and an integer, and returning a string.
* `fn multiply(x: int, y: int) -> int`: A TypeScript function `multiply` taking two integer parameters and returning an integer.
* `fn doSomething() public onlyOwner`: A Solidity function `doSomething` with a modifier `onlyOwner` controlling access.

**In Conclusion**: The signature of a function is a concise representation of its declaration, including the number and types of input parameters and the return type. While parameter names may not be explicitly included, they can still influence the function's behavior through type hints or other mechanisms.
