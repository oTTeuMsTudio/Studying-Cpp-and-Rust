# Rust Variable Definition via Let
In Rust, a variable is defined using the `let` statement. The syntax `let variable_name = value;` declares a new variable and assigns it an initial value.

In the specific case of `let first_name = Marcel;`, the variable `first_name` is defined and initialized with the value `"Marcel"`. This means that the variable `first_name` now holds the string literal `"Marcel"`.

Note that by default, Rust variables are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after initialization. If you need to modify the value of a variable, you must use the `mut` keyword when declaring it, as shown in the example `let mut first_name = Marcel;`.

# Rust Variable Reassignment Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut first_name = "Marcel";
    println!("Hello, {first_name}!");

    first_name = "Tom";
    println!("Greetings, {first_name}!");
}
```

In this Rust code snippet, we demonstrate the concept of variable mutation and reuse. The `first_name` variable is initially assigned the value `"Marcel"` and then printed to the console with a greeting message.

**Mutation**

On the second line, `first_name` is reassigned the value `"Tom"`, effectively changing its contents. This is possible because the variable was declared as `mut`, indicating that its value can be modified.

**Reuse**

The updated `first_name` value `"Tom"` is then used in the second greeting message, printing `"Greetings, Tom!"` to the console.

This example showcases how variables can be mutated and reused in Rust, allowing for more efficient and concise code. By reusing the `first_name` variable, we avoid duplicating code and reduce repetition.
