# Rust Variable Definition via Let
In Rust, a variable is defined using the `let` statement. The syntax `let variable_name = value;` declares a new variable and assigns it an initial value.

In the specific case of `let first_name = Marcel;`, the variable `first_name` is defined and initialized with the value `"Marcel"`. This means that the variable `first_name` now holds the string literal `"Marcel"`.

Note that by default, Rust variables are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after initialization. If you need to modify the value of a variable, you must use the `mut` keyword when declaring it, as shown in the example `let mut first_name = Marcel;`.
