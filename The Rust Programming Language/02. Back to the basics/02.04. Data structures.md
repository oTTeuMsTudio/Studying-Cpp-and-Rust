```rust
struct Person {
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
}

fn main() {
    println!("What is your first name?");
    let first_name = read_string();
    println!("What is your last name?");
    let last_name = read_string();
    let person = Person {
        first_name: first_name,
        last_name,
    };
    print_person(&person);
}

fn read_string() -> String {
    let mut input = String::new();
    std::io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("can not read user input");
    let cleaned_input = input.trim().to_string();
    cleaned_input
}

fn print_person(person: &Person) {
    println!("Hello {} {}", person.first_name, person.last_name);
}
```
**Breakdown of the Rust Code:**

**1. Defining a Struct:**
```rust
struct Person {
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
}
```
- This line defines a new struct named `Person`.
- A struct is a custom data type that groups related values.
- In this case, the `Person` struct has two fields: `first_name` and `last_name`, both of type `String`.

**2. Main Function:**
```rust
fn main() {
    // ...
}
```
- This is the entry point of the program.
- It prompts the user for their first and last name.
- It calls the `read_string` function to get the user's input.
- It creates a new `Person` instance with the provided names.
- It calls the `print_person` function to display a greeting message.

**3. `read_string` Function:**
```rust
fn read_string() -> String {
    // ...
}
```
- This function reads a line of text from the standard input.
- It uses `std::io::stdin()` to get a handle to the standard input stream.
- It calls `read_line` to read a line of text into the `input` string.
- It trims the input to remove leading and trailing whitespace.
- It returns the cleaned input string.

**4. `print_person` Function:**
```rust
fn print_person(person: &Person) {
    // ...
}
```
- This function takes a reference to a `Person` struct as input.
- It prints a greeting message to the console, using the `first_name` and `last_name` fields of the `Person` struct.

**How the Code Works:**
1. The program starts by defining the `Person` struct.
2. The `main` function prompts the user for their name.
3. The `read_string` function is called twice to read the first and last names.
4. A new `Person` instance is created with the user's input.
5. The `print_person` function is called to print a greeting message using the information from the `Person` instance.

**Key Points:**
- **Struct:** A way to group related data.
- **Function:** A block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Input/Output:** Reading and writing data to the console.
- **String Manipulation:** Trimming whitespace from strings.
- **Reference:** A way to refer to a value without copying it.

This code demonstrates basic input/output, string manipulation, and struct usage in Rust.
