In the expanded Hello World example, a single variable `first_name` is introduced. This variable is initialized with the string value `"Marcel"` using the `let` statement. The variable is then used in the `println!` macro to print a personalized greeting message.

**Key Takeaways**

* A variable `first_name` is declared and assigned the value `"Marcel"`.
* The variable is used as a placeholder in the `println!` macro to insert the value into the greeting message.
* The resulting output is `Hello, Marcel!`.

This modification demonstrates how variables can be used to customize the output of a program, making it more dynamic and flexible. In this case, the variable `first_name` allows for easy substitution of different names, enabling the program to generate personalized greetings.
